There are many font creation programs, but many of these are only accessible to people willing to pay ridiculous prices ranging from $50-$200.

If one is looking to create his or her own font for free, it can be difficult to find exactly what the individual may want with the limited selection of programs on the web.  Some programs are aimed at a specific type of font, such as graffiti, while others only let you convert types of font files.

In truth, there are not many free programs that don't limit the user in what he or she can do.  The programs that do exist, such as FontForge, still have some limitations.  Some limitations of FontForge are it's use on anything other than Linux/Unix, and language barriers.

My goal is to help make font creation software available to a wider range of users than it currently is.  I plan on doing this by helping with the documentation for FontForge, and also working on translating the tutorials, and possibly the site into Spanish.
