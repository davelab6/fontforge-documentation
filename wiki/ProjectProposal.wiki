#summary The proposal for the project.

== Why font creation? ==
At first, fonts might seem irrelevant and font creation not worth a second thought.  As a member of a new promotion company, and a currently underground R&B/Neo-Soul artist, however, fonts play more of a role than one would expect. 

I help with promotion for both of these, which includes creating flyers, digitally edited photographs, etc; of course I would need to include text on some of these, such as the group's name, times of events or other important information.  In order to be more artistic, I would prefer to use interesting or eye catching fonts.  Most of the ones that come with Photoshop, or Paint, or whichever program is being used are copyrighted.  This means that in order to use them for commercialization, the user must pay a fee.  For some groups, such as underground artists or start-up companies, unnecessary costs can be a problem.

Solution?  Either creating your own font which you are then free to use as you wish, or finding other copyright free fonts on the web.

This isnâ€™t a complete solution, however, because most of the programs available for font editing or creation are commercialized and priced anywhere from $50 for a home edition to around $200 dollars.  There are free programs available, but most of them are extremely limited in what they allow the user to do.  Even the best ones still have limitations.

And non-copyright fonts, such as those available through the Open Font Library (http://openfontlibrary.org/) can still be restrictive as they may not have exactly what you are looking for.

My goal for this project is to help font creation programs become less restrictive to users.

== Why FontForge? ==
There must be multiple font creation programs on the web, so why FontForge?

There are different types of font creation programs.  For my purposes, I have separated the programs into 2 major groups.  Here is a list of the groups, and an example or two of each:

  # *Online Programs* - These programs allow you to create fonts online without downloading or installing any software.  
    * _example:_ FontStruct (http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/).
  # *Vector Manipulation Program* - These programs allow you to create more complex fonts using vector manipulation.
    * _example:_ FontForge (fontforge.sourceforge.net)
    * _example:_ DoubleType_ (doubletype.org)
